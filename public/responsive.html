	<p>Women's Day, observed annually on March 8, is a day to honor and celebrate the achievements of women from around the world. With efforts dating back as early as 1908, the occasion is an official holiday in more than two dozen countries.
	It is a time to recognize the amazingly influential women throughout history and today — from business to politics to athletics to philanthropy to celebrity. And it is a time to celebrate the amazing women we interact with on a daily basis and to express respect, appreciation and love.</p>
